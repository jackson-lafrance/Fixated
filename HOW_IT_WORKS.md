# How Fixated Works

## Overview
Fixated is a gamified habit tracking app where you level up by completing habits and improving your skills.

## How It Works

### 1. **Skills System**
- Go to **Skills** page
- Select a category (Physical, Mental, Creative, Social, Productivity)
- Add skills from the library (each starts at 50/100 rating)
- Skills are organized by category

### 2. **Habits System**
- Go to **Habits** page
- Create a habit and link it to a skill
- Complete habits daily to progress

### 3. **Progression System**
When you complete a habit:
- **+50 Experience** → Increases your overall level (every 1000 XP = 1 level)
- **+2 Skill Rating** → Increases the linked skill's rating (max 100/100)
- **Streak Counter** → Tracks consecutive days completed

### 4. **Dashboard**
- View your level, experience, and overall rating
- See all your skills organized by category
- Navigate to Skills or Habits pages

## Navigation
- **Dashboard** - Main page showing your stats
- **Skills** - Add and manage skills
- **Habits** - Create and complete habits
- Navigation bar at top of every page
