# Scripts Created

I've created `count_unpushed.sh` in `/Users/jacksonlafrance/Fixated/`.

## To Use:

```bash
cd /Users/jacksonlafrance/Fixated
chmod +x count_unpushed.sh
bash count_unpushed.sh
```

Or if it still doesn't work, try:
```bash
bash /Users/jacksonlafrance/Fixated/count_unpushed.sh
```

The script will count all unpushed commits and calculate how many to push per day over 14 days.
