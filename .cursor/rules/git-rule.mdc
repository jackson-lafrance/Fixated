## Git Workflow Rules

### Branch Management
- Always create a new branch for each feature (check for existing relevant branches first)
- Use naming convention: `feat-feature-name` for features
- Create PRs when finishing a feature and ensure no merge conflicts before merging
- Make frequent commits - commit after every small change or logical unit of work
- Never commit directly to main - always use feature branches

### File Structure
React file structure should be:
- `core/` - Types, contexts, .ts files, utilities (anything that doesn't belong in views/components)
- `components/` - Reusable components sorted into:
  - `ComponentName/`
    - `index.ts` - Export file
    - `ComponentName.tsx` - Component file
    - `ComponentName.css` - Styles
- `views/` - Page-level views (same structure as components)

### Code Standards
- Use camelCase for variable names
- Keep code clean and self-commenting (no comments needed)
- Follow consistent style across all code
- Analyze the whole project before making big decisions
- Write and pass tests using Jest when necessary

### Project Context
This is a gamified 'lock in' React website and React Native app called Fixated:
- Focus: Habit tracking, progress tracking, gamification
- Features: Daily goals, ranks, leveling up, stats (strength, intelligence, etc.)
- Philosophy: Progression vs yourself (self-improvement focus)
- Visualizations: Lots of graphs/charts comparing today vs yesterday
- Skills: Library of skills (meditation, running, lifting, intelligence, reading, math, history, geography, etc.)
- Rating System: NBA 2K style out of 100 rating overall
- Major skill sections with overall ratings, minor categories with individual ratings
- Firebase: Accounts and data storage
- Separate directories for web and React Native app
- Push commits separately for web and mobile

### Firebase Configuration
```typescript
const firebaseConfig = {
  apiKey: "AIzaSyDLRLQcrtGcggkfc2YA-f5FgWonCZouCRM",
  authDomain: "fixated-47de3.firebaseapp.com",
  projectId: "fixated-47de3",
  storageBucket: "fixated-47de3.firebasestorage.app",
  messagingSenderId: "988883657339",
  appId: "1:988883657339:web:606471aad7b02060ee38de",
  measurementId: "G-D09YDPY073"
};
```

### Worktree Management (CRITICAL)
- **MANDATORY**: Use worktrees for parallel development
- Create worktrees for each feature branch
- Each agent works in their assigned worktree
- Commit frequently in your worktree (after every change)
- Head agent monitors and coordinates worktrees
- Clean up untracked files regularly
- Sync worktrees before starting new work
- Never work directly in main repository - always use worktrees

### Commit Guidelines
- Commit after every small change
- Use descriptive commit messages
- Format: "feat: description" or "fix: description" or "refactor: description"
- Include what was changed in commit message
- Never leave uncommitted changes overnight

### Merge Conflict Prevention
- Check for conflicts before starting work on shared files
- Coordinate with head agent if modifying core files
- Pull latest changes before starting new features
- Resolve conflicts immediately when detected

### Head Agent Responsibilities
- Monitor all worktrees continuously
- Auto-commit changes periodically
- Clean up untracked files
- Detect and report conflicts
- Assign new work to available worktrees
- Generate status reports
- Coordinate merges

### Quality Standards
- All code must be tested
- No console.logs in production code
- Handle errors gracefully
- Follow TypeScript best practices
- Ensure responsive design
- Optimize for performance
