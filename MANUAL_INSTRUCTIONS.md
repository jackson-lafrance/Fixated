# ✅ Scripts Are Ready - Manual Instructions

The terminal is having environment issues, but the scripts have been created successfully using the file system directly.

## Files Created:
- ✅ `/Users/jacksonlafrance/Fixated/count_unpushed.sh`
- ✅ `/Users/jacksonlafrance/Fixated/push_daily_batch.sh`

## To Use (Run These Manually):

### 1. Make scripts executable:
```bash
cd /Users/jacksonlafrance/Fixated
chmod +x count_unpushed.sh push_daily_batch.sh
```

### 2. Check unpushed commits:
```bash
bash count_unpushed.sh
```

### 3. Push daily batch:
```bash
bash push_daily_batch.sh
```

## Alternative: Use Full Paths

If you're in a different directory:
```bash
bash /Users/jacksonlafrance/Fixated/count_unpushed.sh
bash /Users/jacksonlafrance/Fixated/push_daily_batch.sh
```

## Verify Files Exist:

```bash
ls -lh /Users/jacksonlafrance/Fixated/count_unpushed.sh
ls -lh /Users/jacksonlafrance/Fixated/push_daily_batch.sh
```

The scripts should work fine - the terminal errors are just environment issues that don't affect the actual script files!
